All of our tools should run as region North America and as availability zone distributed to West US AZ(California) or East US AZ(Ohio).

Bitbucket is used as version controller and repository.

Jenkins clones selected version of the application from master branch on Bitbucket build docker image and push image to ECR.
By next task, jenkins logins to EC2 instances(ECS can be use as alternative)and pull the image from ECR and run the container on the hosts.

Our application runs on a cluster from 3 EC2 instances.

Before a request from a customer to our application comes it will be come to Route53 for resolving the dns and forwarded to ELB for routing on a available host.
 
For caching data I choose ElasticCache. As a relational database we can use RDS from Amazon services and for the rest of our data we can use DynmaoDB as NoSQL database.
 
Its possible to use Kinesis for data streaming and que.Additionaly for our metadata and object storage we can use S3 Object storage.
 
For a better netwok isolation its good to use VPC.
 
At least for monitoring our tools on VPC, CloudWatch is a alternative for monitoring and to authenticate users on our instances we can integrate ActiceDirectory as IAM.
 
On second design Amazon services are replaced with alternative opensource tools which are running on EC2 instances to decrease costs. This flow is similar with IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service).
